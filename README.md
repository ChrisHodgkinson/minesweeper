# MINESWEEPER

A project that started as a challenge from a work colleague.
"Could you write a Minesweeper game?"

"Of course I could." I replied, "It'd be easy."

Oops.

I really should learn to think before speaking.

After a few weeks of an hour or so every few days and a lot of hair pulling trying to work out how to do things I finally got a working game.  It's not flashy and doesn't have any front end or game over screen but it works.

The project makes use of the free 'Mouse Hover' plug-in by BTN which is available from the Corona Marketplace 
https://marketplace.coronalabs.com/corona-plugins/mouse-hover
This is for a purely cosmetic effect and is not essential for the game to work.

I also used the Conthrax-SB font as it's one that I relly like, but you'll have to download that yourself or use something different.

So here it is.  Feel free to have a play around with it, change it, learn from it etc.  
No real need to credit me but I'd be curious to see what you do with it so please drop me a message.

or drop me a pm over at the Corona forums, username Appletreeman.

## How to play

Try to clear the board by marking all of the mines.  
Left click to clear a cell you think has no mine in it.  
CTRL + Click to mark a cell where you think a mine may be.  
CTRL + Click again to unmark a cell.  
Any numbers revealed show how many mines are in the 8 immediateley adjoining cells.

Have fun.
